Hi there,

I compile RRTMG with the Portland Group F90 compiler. You can obtain
the community edition of that for free. Once you've got a working
compiler, head over to the module you want to compile and enter the
build directory, where you can compile with (for the case of the LW 
module and the portland group compiler):

make -f makefiles/linux_rrtmg_lw_linux_pgi

then, move that over to your work directory (or link them) with the
names rrtmg_lw or rrtmg_sw, for the respective modules.
