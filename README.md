# SIRACHA

Hi there! Welcome to SiRaChA - the Simultaneous Radiative and
Chemical rexlation of the Atmosphere. Check out the example
script in the work directory for an introduction.

If you'd like to use siracha for research that you'd like to publish,
please contact me first (Edward.Charlesworth.Science@Gmail.com) and
give me a heads-up of what you'd like to do. You probably need to
anyhow to check that the model will really work for your purposes, but
I'd just like to make sure I'm not tredding over somebody else's work
and that nobody is tredding over mine. If you make a change to the 
model, please also make that version freely available.

Happy modeling!
